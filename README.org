* lein-maven-s3-wagon
** What is this?
   This is a leiningen plugin that wraps my fork of maven-s3-wagon.
** What is an S3 wagon?
   It is a maven plugin that allows you to publish and retrieve maven
   artifacts directly from S3.
** Why did you fork maven-s3-wagon?
   I forked it because I wanted an S3 wagon:
   1. That supports AWS multi-factor authentication (which
      maven-s3-wagon does), and
   2. That supports private S3 repos (which maven-s3-wagon does).
** Sooo, why did you fork it again?
   As far as I can tell, maven-s3-wagon doesn't actually support using
   multi-factor authentication except if you're running maven on an
   EC2 node.  In addition to pulling in your access key and secret key
   from the environment, my fork also pulls in your session token from
   the environment, but maybe I should just let you go check out the
   [[http://github.com/pjstadig/maven-s3-wagon/][README]] on that fork.

   Also, the way you publish to a private S3 repo with maven-s3-wagon
   is by configuring it to use a private ACL in your
   ~/.m2/settings.xml.  As far as I can tell, there is no way to do
   this with leiningen (patches welcome!).  My fork uses a private ACL
   as its default ACL.
** OK, so how do I use it?
   Add it to your project.clj as a plugin and define your repository:
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
     (defproject my-project "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
       ...
       :deploy-repositories [["my-private-repo" {:url "s3://my-maven-repo/releases/"
                                                 :username "bogus" :password "bogus"}]]
       ...
       :plugins [[lein-maven-s3-wagon "0.2.0"]]
       ...)
   #+END_SRC

   Then you can publish your artifact to S3 using:
   
   : lein deploy my-private-repo
** What's this "bogus" stuff?
   leiningen expects you to either specify your credentials in your
   project.clj or specify them in ~/.lein/credentials.clj.gpg.  It
   does not have a concept of pulling credentials from the
   environment, so if you want maven-s3-wagon to pull credentials from
   the environment, then you need to provide some bogus credentials
   /that will be ignored/.
   
   If you do not want maven-s3-wagon to pull credentials from the
   environment you can provide your access key as ~:username~ and
   secret key as ~:password~ in your project.clj or in your
   ~/.lein/credentials.clj.gpg, but in this case multi-factor
   authentication will not work.
